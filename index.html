<h2>About QuizMaster</h2>

<p><b>QuizMaster</b> is a web based application intended for users to take quizzes. We want customers/users to have the ultimate experience with features like randomization of multiple choice questions so that people taking the same quiz do not have the same order. This way two people taking the same quiz next to each other are less likely able to view others answers. Want to set a time limit? No problem. Some quizzes will have a time limit set while others might not. Users that take a quiz want to see immediate results but will not to be able to view the correct answer to discourage giving the correct one to others.  Users will want to see their scores and how they improve over time so they will be given the option to retake quizzes if needed. </p>

Quizzes will be separated by courses such as Science, English, Math, and History. We hope to incorporate different types of questions like true/false, multiple choice, and even questions based on a given piture likee the one shown on the right!</p>
