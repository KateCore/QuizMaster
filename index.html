<h2>About QuizMaster</h2>

<p><b>QuizMaster</b> is a web based application intended for users to manage, take quizzes, and even create them! We want customers to have the ultimate experience with features like randomization of multiple choice questions. Want to set a time limit? No problem. Users that take a quiz want to see immediate results but quiz creators will have the option to hide the correct answer and reveal them later.</p>
